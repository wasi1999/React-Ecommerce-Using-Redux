          At LA COLLECTION, innovation isn't just about making our products the best; it’s about improving lives. Thinking innovatively across every area of the business has the power to improve our world, lend a helping hand or spark a movement. It can also lead to industry-changing ideas and technology such as collaborative robots, motion sensors, Blockchain, 3D printing, augmented reality, voice recognition, and new polymer developments.

          We believe best ideas emerge from the creative connections that happen between our talented employees. We encourage our multi-functional teams to work together to come up with new ideas to address challenges we face. And we enable this through creative frameworks and inspiring office spaces designed by specialized architects—because a creative and dynamic work environment is key to bringing dynamic ideas to life.
